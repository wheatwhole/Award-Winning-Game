# what is award winning game
in this pixel platformer adventure, the world has been thrown into chaos after a rogue chemist unleashed a powerful ancient potion, permanently flooding the Earth with unstable magical energy. I havent come up with a name for this yet, so I just called it 'award winning game' since that is what it's gonna be anyways. please excuse the unclear commit messages and 'monobranch' type management.
